        <div class="intro-section">
            <p class="intro-text">
                Ever since I could walk, I always had a strange fascination with vending machines. The complex inner workings. The simplistic outer design. The reliability, efficiency, and everlasting nature. The idea that something so physically large and complex could provide such a simple service. 
                What began as a child's wonder has evolved into a true study of user experience design. This website explores the fascinating intersection of technology, design, and human behavior that vending machines represent. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="intro-text" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                Our research involved three participants with varying levels of experience using vending machines. The following section presents their responses to our questions, highlighting common patterns and unique perspectives on vending machine usability.

        <h2 class="section-title">Background/Case Study</h2>
        <div class="intro-section">
            <p class="intro-text">
                This case study was conducted at the SciLi, where I observed users interacting with the vending machine located in the lobby. I positioned myself nearby and watched as people approached the machine, made their selections, and completed their purchases. After each user finished their transaction, I approached them and asked if they would be willing to answer a few interview questions about their experience. This observational and interview-based approach allowed me to gather both behavioral data and subjective feedback about the vending machine's usability. I interviewed three participants.

                <li>All users seemed very comfortable using the vending machine. The majority (2/3) used cashless payment methods; the other used cash to pay for their drink.</li>
                <li>Users on average only spent 15-30 seconds at the vending machine.</li>
                <li>The majority of the time spent was deciding which payment method to use (Flex Points, Credit Card, Apple Pay, or Cash). Once payment was made, users spent very little time deciding which drink to buy.</li>

                    <p class="answer-text">All respondents noted that the images of various drinks helped them decide which button to press. Additionally, the payment area had a small depiction of money, which clarified what it was used for. The drink dispenser area additionally was the only section of the vending machine that had an open compartment, which implied that the drinks were dispensed there. The overall sentiment was that vending machines followed traditional design rules, and everything could be deduced using "common sense."</p>

                    <p class="answer-text">Respondents overall had positive sentiments with regards to this vending machine. One respondent noted that the payment area was a little convoluted and he had to swipe his credit card twice before it accepted it. Another respondent noted that the images of the drink did not necessarily match the flavor of what was dispensed. For example, he selected a "Power-C Dragonfruit Vitamin Water", but was given an "Acai Blueberry Pomegranate Vitamin Water" instead. While these flavors are similar, the labels by each button were incorrect.</p>

                <div class="answer-container">
                    <p class="answer-text">One respondent wished there was a way to deselect a button. She mistakenly selected the "Coca Cola" button instead of the "Coke Zero" button, and had no way of returning this item. Another respondent wished that the payment terminal was more transparent about types of payment methods they accepted. While the vending machine itself had a sticker saying it accepted flex points, swiping a Brown ID card did not work and the payment terminal said that payment method was not valid. All three respondents additionally said they wished the vending machine worked faster; from start to finish, the process could sometimes take up to one minute.</p>

            <p class="intro-text">To better understand the diverse users of vending machines and their unique needs, I developed personas based on my research findings. These personas help illustrate the different motivations, behaviors, and pain points of typical vending machine users. By creating these representative user profiles, we can better design and improve vending machine interfaces to meet the needs of various user groups, from busy office workers in need of a quick snack to food science students looking for a healthy snack.</p>

            <p class="intro-text">Storyboards are essential tools in user experience design that help visualize the complete journey of user interaction. By breaking down the vending machine usage process into sequential steps, we can better understand user behaviors, pain points, and opportunities for improvement. These visual narratives allow us to empathize with users and identify potential usability issues before they become problems in the real world. Below is a storyboard for the vending machine I observed.</p>
